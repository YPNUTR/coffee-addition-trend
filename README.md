## Supplementary Figures

Supplementary figures follow the file name format ***Repo Figure X-Y***, where:

- X = 1 (by *weight*) or 2 (by *energy))

- Y = coffee component listed in the table below:

| **Y** | **Component**            |
| ----: | ------------------------ |
|     0 | Total coffee             |

### General Footnote

> a. p value = significance of subgroup–cycle interactions, tested using survey-weighted Wald F tests;
> b. NHANES = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
> Error bars represent standard errors of survey-weighted estimates. Participants with missing information on education, ratio of family poverty-to-income, body mass index, weekly work hours, or daily sleep hours were excluded from significance tests. Participants with body mass index <18.5 kg/m² were excluded owing to limited sample size. Data on daily sleep hours were collected beginning in NHANES 2005–2006.
